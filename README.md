### Exercise 8 - Dice

<br/>

## DICE Project

<br/>

You have been hired by devsInc to create a landing page for their
new project. They want to support people playing tabletop games
from home and require a Dice Generator.

<br/>

> Features:
> The user should be able to use different dice, such as a D6 or a D10
> (number of faces).

<br/>

Define on paper, all the user stories (functionalities) you will need
for this page.

- Make a simple storyboard of the user using the system.
- Create a git repository for the project
- Clone the project locally
- Work on the project creating 2 branches, one for the UI, and one
  for rolling the dice, committing and merging when completed.
- Create the roll functionality by passing an argument, in order to
  reutilise the same function multiple times
- Write unit tests for the roll dice functionality.
- When complete, push the content to your git repository.
